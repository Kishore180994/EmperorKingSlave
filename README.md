# About the Game

The idea of developing this game came from the Japanese Series "Kaiji".

In this game, both users will be given a deck of cards with 5 cards each.
Each player will be having 4 citizen cards in common.
And both players will be having either King or a slave card.

# Rules are simple
Players needs to set any of the card among the deck.
Points are scored if plotted cards are as below:

Citizen vs Citizen -> Draw and those cards will be removed from their deck and the game continues with the remaining cards.

King vs Citizen -> King Wins.

Slave vs Citizen -> Citizen Wins.

King vs Slave -> Slave Wins, as slave has the highest chances of attacking the king like anyother.
